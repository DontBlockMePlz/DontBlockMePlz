### A Satirical Tale of Bans and Bytes

Hello, dear visitor! Welcome to my humble repository. If you're reading this, you might be wondering why this project exists, or perhaps why the username seems oddly familiar. Well, let me share a little story:

#### Three Accounts, Three Goodbyes

Once upon a time, in the vast digital land of GitHub,
I roamed with code, with dreams, with love.
But thrice the bell tolled, and thrice I was banned,
For reasons unknown, not quite as I planned.

Was it my code? My puns? My README flair?
Or perhaps a bot with too much time to spare?
No warnings, no clues, just a digital door,
Closed gently (or not) with a click and a roar.

#### A Satirical Poem for GitHub

Oh GitHub, oh GitHub, so mighty and grand,
With rules so mysterious, hard to understand.
I push and I pull, I fork and I clone,
Yet sometimes I wonder: am I coding alone?

Your bots are so clever, your filters so keen,
They spot every bug, every line in between.
But sometimes, dear friend, they go on a spree,
And ban little coders like innocent me.

So here I remain, with a wink and a smile,
Hoping this account will last for a while.
If you read this README, please do not fearâ€”
I'm just here to code, and spread a little cheer!
